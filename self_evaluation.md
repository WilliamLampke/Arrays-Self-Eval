How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I took some intro to python and javascript courses so I have a pretty good understanding of the different data structures and what they are used for.
Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
No arrays/lists are pretty simple dictionaries is where it gets annoying because manipulating those can be tricky.
What questions do you have about Arrays?
Why not call them lists? :D
